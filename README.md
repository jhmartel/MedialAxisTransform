# MedialAxisTransform

This directory contains a preprint on Blum's Medial Axis Transform.

Our goal is to apply the results of our PhD thesis and using an idea of Hubbard to construct natural nonpositively curved metrics on arbitrary open bounded 
subsets A of R^N. These NPC metrics are incomplete, but are still useful in exhibiting the medial axis transform as the singularity locus of an optimal transport
from the interior of the set A to its boundary Î´A.

The key difficulty in this preprint is in generalizing an important curvature formula of Ahlfors--Bers which identifies the sectional curvature with the Laplacian 
of the conformal factor.
